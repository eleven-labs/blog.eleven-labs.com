Containers are widely used today from development to production. However, a `docker stats` in ssh does not allow you to correctly assess your production environment. We will therefore see how to meet this monitoring need for containers in production.

We will discuss several technologies to meet this need:
- [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor), solution made open-source by Google which allows all container metrics to be exposed.
- [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus), open-source solution for time series oriented databases.
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), open-source solution for easily configurable dashboards which will help draw nice graphs.

> **Resource:**
> [ctop](https://ctop.sh/) allows you to view `docker stats` info in` htop` style.

The stack that we are going to see works like this:

- `cAdvisor` will expose the `http://cadvisor:8080/metrics` endpoint with all the metrics of the containers at a given time `t`.

- `Prometheus` will query every `x` seconds the endpoint from cAdvisor and store metrics in its database.

- `Grafana` will display metrics from Prometheus in the form of graphs.

Before you begin, make sure you have `docker` and` docker-compose` installed. My versions for writing this article are:

```bash
> $ docker --version; docker-compose --version
Docker version 17.11.0-ce, build 1caf76c
docker-compose version 1.17.1, build 6d101fb
```

For starters, we're going to quickly install an app, take for example [Api Platform](https://api-platform.com/).

```bash
> $ git clone git@github.com:api-platform/api-platform.git
> $ cd api-platform
> $ git checkout v2.1.4
> $ docker-compose up
> $ open http://127.0.0.1
```
We now have access to the documentation for the API you just installed.

## cAdvisor

We are going to add `cAdvisor` to `docker-compose.yml`:

> **Resource:**
> you can find [`docker-compose.yml` and `prometheus.yml` files here](https://gist.github.com/qneyrat/318e7433b8c4de9edeccbac8ef0ec335).

```yml
services:
...
  cadvisor:
    image: google/cadvisor
    container_name: cadvisor
    volumes:
      - /:/rootfs:ro
      - /var/run:/var/run:rw
      - /sys:/sys:ro
      - /var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro
    expose:
      - 8080
    ports:
      - "8005:8080"
    networks:
      - monitoring

networks:
  monitoring:
    driver: bridge
```

Let's restart `docker-compose`.

```bash
> $ docker-compose build
> $ docker-compose up
> $ open http://localhost:8005/docker/
```

We can now access `cAdvisor`'s interface.

This already allows us to see briefly the metrics of our containers.

However, this solution alone is not configurable enough and cannot fully meet our needs.

## Prometheus

Let's begin by installing `Prometheus`:

```yml
services:
...
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:v2.0.0
    container_name: prometheus
    volumes:
    - ./docker/prometheus/:/etc/prometheus/
    - prometheus-data:/prometheus
    command:
    - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'
    - '--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus'
    - '--web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries'
    - '--web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles'
    - '--storage.tsdb.retention=200h'
    expose:
    - 9090
    ports:
    - "9090:9090"
    networks:
    - monitoring

volumes:
...
  prometheus-data: {}
```

And let's add the configuration file `prometheus.yml` into the `docker/prometheus` folder.

```yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'docker-host-alpha'

rule_files:
  - "targets.rules"
  - "host.rules"
  - "containers.rules"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'cadvisor'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['cadvisor:8080']

  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 10s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```

We can notice the `cadvisor` scraping job on the` cadvisor: 8080` endpoint. Prometheus will always scrape according to the following scheme:

```
<host>:<port>/metrics
```

For configuration, the `/metrics` is implied.

We can restart `docker-compose` again.

```bash
> $ docker-compose build
> $ docker-compose up
> $ open http://localhost:9090/targets
```

We can see that the jobs we configured are up. That is to say that `Prometheus` has managed to scrape the metrics from` cAdvisor` and `Prometheus`.

## Grafana

We are going to install `Grafana` now:

```yml
services:
...
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:4.6.2
    container_name: grafana
    volumes:
      - grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana
    expose:
      - 3000
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    networks:
      - monitoring

volumes:
...
  grafana-data: {}
```

Let's restart `docker-compose` one last time.

```bash
> $ docker-compose build
> $ docker-compose up
> $ open http://localhost:3000
```

> **Access:**
> Default access codes for Grafana are
>admin
>admin

Let's start by adding our `Prometheus` as` Data Sources`. Let's go to [http://localhost:3000/datasources/new](http://localhost:3000/datasources/new) and add the host of our `Prometheus`.

![grafana]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2017-12-12-monitorer-ses-containers-docker/grafana.png)

Now that `Grafana` can access our` Prometheus` all we have to do is create a new dashboard. To save time we will import it directly.

> [https://grafana.com/dashboards/193](https://grafana.com/dashboards/193)

Let's import this new dashboard [http://localhost:3000/dashboard/new?editview=import∨gId=1](http://localhost:3000/dashboard/new?editview=import∨gId=1) and put the template id `193`. Once done, we can go to our dashboard.

> [http://localhost:3000/dashboard/db/docker-monitoring?refresh=10s∨gId=1](http://localhost:3000/dashboard/db/docker-monitoring?refresh=10s∨gId=1)

![dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2017-12-12-monitorer-ses-containers-docker/dashboard.png)

We can now see the system metrics of our containers, like the consumption `cpu` or `ram` for each of them.

Depending on your needs, you can create more specific dashboards with the information you need.
For `Prometheus`, there are many `exporters` to be able to retrieve even more metrics like for example for `Redis` or `RabbitMQ`.
You can also create an `exporter` yourself as long as it exposes metrics on an `HTTP` `/metrics` endpoint or even exposes business metrics from your application.
