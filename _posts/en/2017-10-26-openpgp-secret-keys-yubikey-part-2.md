We saw in the previous article [the generation of OpenPGP keys](/fr/openpgp-paire-clef-presque-parfaite-partie-1/). 
As a reminder, we have in our keychain private keys:

```bash
wilson@spaceship:~$ gpg2 --list-secret-keys

sec#  rsa4096/1A8132B1 2017-10-05 [C] [expires: 2018-10-05]
uid         [ultimate] Wilson Eleven <wilson.eleven@labs.com>
ssb   rsa4096/B73A9C79 2017-10-05 [E] [expires: 2018-10-05]
ssb   rsa4096/9CC8B2FB 2017-10-05 [S] [expires: 2018-10-05]
ssb   rsa4096/8047B454 2017-10-05 [A] [expires: 2018-10-05]
```

We also exported the keys in files:
* 1A8132B1.priv.asc: contains all private keys
* 1A8132B1.pub.asc: contains all public keys
* 1A8132B1.sub_priv.asc: contains only the private keys of the subkeys

With this configuration, we have an effective strategy against theft or loss of the private key that is used for certification.
If an attacker take the computer, he will not be able to certify another key. However, the private keys that allow
to sign, encrypt and authenticate are still present on the computer. So, in case of the theft of the keys, it would be possible 
to sign messages during a certain time (the time that the stolen subkey is revoked).

To counter this attack, it is possible to place private keys in a smart card. These devices are
very resistant to key extraction techniques. In addition to physical attacks, there is a pin code with 3 tries only. Then it's locked.

We will see in this article the export of the private keys of the subkeys in a smart card. For this example, I will use
a Yubikey 4.

### Yubikey, what is it?

Yubikey is a device the size of a classic USB key. This key makes it possible to perform double authentication on website, 
such as Google or Github. Thus, if a person is in possession of both the email and the password of the victim, the attacker 
will not be able to connect without this usb key. This is the principle of double authentication, you must be in possession of two secrets.
   
Yubikey implements an open protocol: *universal 2nd factor*. 

In addition to this main protocol, it supports others: OpenPGP, TOTP, HOTP, challenge-response.

The one that will interest us is OpenPGP.

### How to get one

I recommend you go through [the official store](https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-4-series/)
to ensure the origin of the product. We are on products related to safety, it's important to know where the purchased product comes from.

For those who have a Github account, there is a [promotional offer that allows to have -10%](https://www.yubico.com/github-special-offer/) on the cart. Interesting :).
However, it's valid only once. I recommend you order at least 2 products. The second will be useful to make a backup in the unfortunate event of the loss of the first one.

Last but not least, our OpenPGP key was generated with a size of 4096 bits. Only the version 4 of the Yubikey allows
to save keys of this size. Version 3 and NEO only support keys up to 3072 bits.

### Install the necessary tools

As a reminder, we started our generation of OpenPGP key with a machine running Ubuntu 16.04 and GnuPG 2.1.11. To be able to
export the keys to the Yubikey, we need to install additional tools beforehand.

```bash
wilson@spaceship:~$ sudo apt-get install -y gnupg-agent pinentry-curses scdaemon pcscd yubikey-personalization libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

### Customize the Yubikey with gpg

Before using the Yubikey, check that the warranty tape has not been broken. If so, do not use it.

Insert the Yubikey into a USB port and type the following command to verify that the card is well recognized.
 
```bash
wilson@spaceship:~$ gpg2 --card-status
Reader ...........: 1050:0407:X:0
Application ID ...: D2760001240102010006064764950000
Version ..........: 2.1
Manufacturer .....: Yubico
Serial number ....: 06476495
Name of cardholder: [not set]
Language prefs ...: [not set]
Sex ..............: unspecified
URL of public key : [not set]
Login data .......: [not set]
Signature PIN ....: not forced
Key attributes ...: rsa2048 rsa2048 rsa2048
Max. PIN lengths .: 127 127 127
PIN retry counter : 3 0 3
Signature counter : 0
Signature key ....: [none]
Encryption key....: [none]
Authentication key: [none]
General key info..: [none]
```

The card is blank, there is no personal information. It is recommended to supplement the information in case a
nobody would find this key.

Edit the card and switch to admin mode. You can enter `help` to get the list of available commands.

```bash
wilson@spaceship:~$ gpg2 --card-edit
gpg/card> admin
Admin commands are allowed
```

First of all, we'll change the PIN key administration code and user PIN. By default, the administrator PIN is 12345678 and the user PIN is 123456.

The administrator PIN is required for some operations on the card, such as the key export, and to unlock when a PIN code has been entered 3 times by mistake.

Enter `passwd` to change them. Let's start with the administrator PIN and then the user PIN.

```
gpg/card> passwd
gpg: OpenPGP card no. D2760001240102010006064764950000 detected

1 - change PIN
2 - unblock PIN
3 - change Admin PIN
4 - set the Reset Code
Q - quit

Your selection? 3
PIN changed.

1 - change PIN
2 - unblock PIN
3 - change Admin PIN
4 - set the Reset Code
Q - quit

Your selection? 1
PIN changed.

1 - change PIN
2 - unblock PIN
3 - change Admin PIN
4 - set the Reset Code
Q - quit

Your selection? q
gpg/card>
```

Then enter the information to customize your key:

```bash
gpg/card> name
Cardholder's surname: Wilson
Cardholder's given name: Eleven

gpg/card> lang
Language preferences: fr

gpg/card> login
Login data (account name): wilson.eleven@labs.com

gpg/card> sex
Sex ((M)ale, (F)emale or space): m

gpg/card> quit
```

The key is now configured. We can export the private keys of the subkeys in the smart card.

### Export the keys to the Yubikey

The goal is to move the secret keys of the subkeys into the Yubikey. In order to do so, we will
select each subkey one by one with the `key n` command and move it in the card with` keytocard`.
In the end, there will be no more secrets in the gpg keychain.

Let's edit the key.

```bash
wilson@spaceship:~$ gpg2 --expert --edit-key 1A8132B1

```

Let's export the encryption key to `B73A9C79`.

```bash
gpg> key 1

pub  rsa4096/1A8132B1
     created: 2017-10-05  expires: 2018-10-05  usage: C

```

The small asterisk in front of the key's fingerprint indicates that it's selected.

Enter `keytocard` to export it to the Yubikey. Then type `2` which is the only choice. The Yubikey can store the 3 types
subkeys.

```bash
gpg> keytocard

```

gpg will ask you for the password of the secret encryption key and then the admin pin code of the Yubikey key.
Once the Yubikey admin pin code entered, the secret encryption key is in the Yubikey. We can check it right after 
moving the other two keys.

Let's select the signature key. Deselect the first key and select the second.

```bash
gpg> key 1

[ultimate] (1). Wilson Eleven <wilson.eleven@labs.com>

gpg> 
```

The second key is well selected because there is the small asterisk in front of the key `9CC8B2FB`.

Repeat the operation with `keytocard` command and select `1` because it's a key signature.

```bash
gpg> keytocard
Please select where to store the key:
   (1) Signature key
   (3) Authentication key

```

It's ok for the second key. Repeat with the third.

```bash
gpg> key 2

gpg> 
``` 

We are done. Type `save` and` quit`.

Let's check that we do not have any secret keys in our gpg keychain anymore.

```bash
wilson@spaceship:~$ gpg2 --list-secret-keys
/home/wilson/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
--------------------------------

```

The chevron `>` before `ssb` indicates that the secret key does not exist for this key. It's a stub.

Let's check that these secret keys are in the Yubikey.

```bash
wilson@spaceship:~$ gpg2 --card-status

```

We find the personal information in the first part. Then there is the information
on the keys stored in the Yubikey.

We see that there is the chevron `>` before `ssb`. As seen above, this indicates the absence of the secret key in the
keychain. Just below, there is an extra line that tells gpg where to find the secret key.
Here we have the serial number of the Yubikey `card-no: 0006 06476495`. This serial number is also printed on the key physically.
If you have multiple Yubikeys, it will be easy to find the one you are looking for.

### Conclusion

Through these first two articles, we covered the creation of an OpenPGP key and the export of secrets on a smart card. 
The use of a smart card provides additional protection against the theft of secret keys.
It will not be enough to hack the computer to steal them, but it will be necessary to physically steal 
the key and the associated PIN code to use the secret keys. Moreover, as seen in the introduction, the secret 
key cannot be extracted. Our key is well protected, except against the human factor which remains the only threat.

In addition, you can distribute your public key on [a key server](https://pgp.mit.edu/) and other services (GitHub, Kraken, keybase.io). 
This allows you to receive encrypted messages, and [sign your commits](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/) 
on GitHub (example on this commit [31dd621](https : //github.com/eleven-labs/eleven-labs.github.io/commit/31dd621db58a7ee1428bc9615c23e74d5ac98c3f)).

In a future article, we will set up a backup strategy to cover for the potential loss of secret keys. An error can quickly happen, 
like erasing your computer following a ransomware.

### Remarks

This tutorial uses a Yubikey for storing secrets. Yubikey is the most popular key in the general public, especially
for the second authentication factor feature. There are other keys that support OpenPGP such as [NitroKey](https://www.nitrokey.com/).
Unlike the Yubikey, the NitroKey is open-source. Security with closed and proprietary hardware is not a viable solution in the long term. 
It's also contradictory to the OpenPGP spirit, that aims to be open. However, I chose the Yubikey for its ease of implementation and its ability to do double authentication.
