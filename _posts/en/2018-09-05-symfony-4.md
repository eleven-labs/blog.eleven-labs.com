Symfony 4 has been released more than 6 months ago (30 november 2017). The main change is the way of creating applications and how to append features during the project lifetime.

⚠️ Keep in mind that Symfony 4 now requires **PHP 7.1.3** at least!

## Flex

[Flex](https://github.com/symfony/flex) is the new tool used by Symfony for projects management.
It's a composer plugin aiming to help the developer creating a Symfony application.
 
> ℹ️ It replaces [Symfony standard edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard) and the [Symfony installer](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-installer).

Flex use `recipes` (ɹɛ.sɪ.piz).
A `recipe` is a `manifest.json` file. It contains some actions to take during the installation process.
It allows you to create a folder, copy config files, add some environment variables (.env) etc... 
Full action list in the [documentation](https://github.com/symfony/recipes/blob/master/README.rst).

`recipes` are stored in two repositories:
 * [main recipes repository](https://github.com/symfony/recipes) high quality `recipes`. Flex default repository.
 * [contrib recipes repository](https://github.com/symfony/recipes-contrib) community `recipes`, Flex always asks your permission before installing it.

> ℹ️ You can go to the new website [symfony.sh](https://symfony.sh/) to find `recipes`.

### Usage

Ok, we gonna to show how create Symfony 4 project with Flex.

```
$ composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton my-project

```

> ℹ️ Use `symfony/skeleton` `recipe` to create lightweight project.
> It only requires:
> * symfony/console
> * symfony/flex
> * symfony/framework-bundle
> * symfony/lts
> * symfony/yaml

Flex will create the following folder trees.

```
assets        static ressources (image, js, css, ...)
bin           runnable (console, phpunit, ...)
config        application config files
public        public files (front controller index.php)
src           application source code
templates     templating files (twig, html, ...)
tests         tests files
translations  translation files
var           some temporary files (cache, logs, upload, ...)
vendor        third party library
```

In order to have your first page:

* create the template file `my-project/templates/index.html.twig`

{% raw %}
```twig
{% extends 'base.html.twig' %}
{% block body %}Welcome{% endblock %}
``` 
{% endraw %}

* create controller file `my-project/src/Controller/DefaultController.php` 

{% raw %}
```php
<?php

namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

class DefaultController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * @Route("/", name="index")
     */
    public function index()
    {
        return $this->render('index.html.twig');
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}

> Caution, the controller name is not suffixed by `Action` anymore.

## Where is the bundle? 

You don't have to create the bundle in src (AppBundle).
You can now register your bundle in the `config/bundles.php` file.

{% raw %}
```php
<?php

return [
    // ...
    Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\FrameworkBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    Symfony\Bundle\WebServerBundle\WebServerBundle::class => ['dev' => true],
    // ...
];
``` 
{% endraw %}

## Conclusion

We had several choices before Symfony 4 :

* Use the symfony distribution (standard, cmf-standard, rest ...) or [microkernel](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Kernel/MicroKernelTrait.php).
> Ready to use (ORM, swiftmailer, twig, ...). 
> It can bring useless features (forced to disable/delete).  
    
* Use the Symfony component as third party or use [Silex](https://github.com/silexphp/Silex)
> Lightweight solution.
> Need a strong knowledge in order to initialise all the components with configuration and cache.

Symfony 4 was reworked to ease the initialisation process and not to bring unwanted components.
It helps to manage features along the project lifetime.

There is the top 3 [Symfony 4.0 changes](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/UPGRADE-4.0.md) :
* New folder structure.
* `LockHandler` replaced by `Symfony\Component\Lock\Store\FlockStore`/`Symfony\Component\Lock\Store\FlockStore\SemaphoreStore`
* ClassLoader replaced by composer autoload.

PS : I advise you to visit again [Symfony component list](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/master/src/Symfony/Component), 
because now you need to use `recipe` or compose your need with a third party library.
