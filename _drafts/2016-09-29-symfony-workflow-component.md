Since Symfony 3.2, a new useful component was born: the <a href="http://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-2-workflow-component">Workflow component</a>.

It is indeed really convenient and can simplify greatly your developments when you have to manage status workflows in your application, that occurs a lot.

&nbsp;

**Installation**

In all cases, you have to install the following dependency:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">
{% raw %}
"symfony/workflow": "~3.2@dev"{% endraw %}
</pre>

If you use an earlier version of Symfony but &gt;=2.3 you are also able to use this component, but you have to install the following non-official bundle, which loads the component itself and add the required configuration under the bundle's namespace:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">
{% raw %}
"fduch/workflow-bundle": "~0.2@dev"{% endraw %}
</pre>

Do not forget to enable the bundle in your kernel class.

&nbsp;

**Configuration**

Time has come to write our workflow configuration. We will have to define all our places (statuses / states) and available transitions.

In this blog post, we will take a pull request status example. A pull request can have one of the following status: <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">opened</span> , <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">closed</span> , <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">needs_review</span> , <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">reviewed</span>  or <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">merged</span>.

However, it cannot be, for instance, moved from the <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">merged</span> status without having the <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">reviewed</span>  status before. The workflow component makes sense here.

&nbsp;

Here is our full workflow configuration:

<pre class="lang:yaml decode:true">
{% raw %}
workflow:
    workflows:
        pull_request:
            marking_store:
                type: multiple_state
                arguments:
                    - state
            supports:
                - AppBundle\Entity\PullRequest
            places:
                - opened
                - closed
                - needs_review
                - reviewed
                - merged
            transitions:
                feedback:
                    from: opened
                    to:   needs_review
                review:
                    from: [opened, needs_review]
                    to:   reviewed
                merge:
                    from: reviewed
                    to:   merged
                close:
                    from: [opened, needs_review, reviewed]
                    to:   closed{% endraw %}
</pre>

Here, we specify we want to use a <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">multiple_state</span>  workflow. Please not that if you want to use a simple transition from one state to another, you can use a <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">single_state</span> .

For this example, we also have defined a <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">AppBundle\Entity\PullRequest</span> class which has a <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">state</span>  property and associated setter and getter methods (component will use these methods to manage transitions):

<pre class="lang:php decode:true">
{% raw %}
&lt;?php

namespace AppBundle\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ORM\Table(name="pull_request")
 */
class PullRequest
{
    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type="json_array", nullable=true)
     */
    protected $state;

    public function setState($state)
    {
        $this-&gt;state = $state;
    }

    public function getState()
    {
        return $this-&gt;state;
    }
}{% endraw %}
</pre>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Everything is now ready, we can start to use the Workflow component!

&nbsp;

**Usage**

First useful thing to do after you have written your workflow configuration is to generate a graph using the Symfony command. The command will generate one graph using the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> format.

&nbsp;

Here is the Symfony command you have to run:

<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">
{% raw %}
$ bin/console workflow:dump pull_request{% endraw %}
</pre>

The generated Graphviz will give you the following diagram:

<a href="http://blog.eleven-labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Capture-d’écran-2016-09-26-à-20.50.44-1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2288 aligncenter" src="http://blog.eleven-labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Capture-d’écran-2016-09-26-à-20.50.44-1.png" alt="Workflow - Graphviz" width="879" height="224" /></a>

This one gives you a really clear vision of your workflow and allows everyone at every level (developers, product owners, customers, ...) to understand the business logic.

The Workflow component implements methods that allow you to verify if a transition is applicable and to later apply it depending on the current status and to also list all enabled transitions.

&nbsp;

In order to check if you can apply a specific transition and apply it, simply use the following code:

<pre class="lang:php decode:true">
{% raw %}
&lt;?php

namespace AppBundle\Controller;

use AppBundle\Manager\PullRequestManager;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\RedirectResponse;

class PullRequestController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * @param int $identifier A pull request identifier.
     *
     * @return RedirectResponse
     */
    public function update($identifier)
    {
        ...

        // Notre pull request est au statut "reviewed"
        $pullRequest = $this-&gt;getPullRequestManager()-&gt;find($identifier);

        // Nous obtenons le service "workflow.&lt;nom du workflow&gt;"
        $workflow = $this-&gt;get('workflow.pull_request');

        if ($workflow-&gt;can($pullRequest, 'merge')) {
            $workflow-&gt;apply($pullRequest, 'merge');
        }

        ...
    }
}{% endraw %}
</pre>

In the case you do not want to use the <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">can()</span> method, the <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">apply()</span> <span id="crayon-57ea364c0a715059785852" class="crayon-syntax crayon-syntax-inline crayon-theme-classic crayon-theme-classic-inline crayon-font-monaco"><span class="crayon-pre crayon-code"><span class="crayon-sy"> one</span></span></span> will throw an exception if the transition cannot be effectively done, so you will be able to catch exceptions on the <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">Symfony\Component\Workflow\Exception\LogicException</span> type.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

To list all enabled transitions:

<pre class="lang:php decode:true">
{% raw %}
$workflow-&gt;getEnabledTransitions($pullRequest);{% endraw %}
</pre>

Overall, the component usage is just as simple as these 3 methods. As you can see, complex workflows are now easier to manage!

&nbsp;

**Tune in for events!**

The component also dispatches multiple events, chronologically sorted as:

<ul>
<li><span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">workflow.leave</span>: when our pull request will leave its current state,</li>
<li><span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">workflow.transition</span>: when the transition to the new state is launched,</li>
<li><span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">workflow.enter</span>: when the new state is just defined on our pull request,</li>
<li><span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">workflow.guard</span>: this one allows you to prevent the asked transition from occurring, you can do that by calling the following method: <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">$event-&gt;setBlocked(true);</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Finally, you have to know that these events also exist in a unique way for each workflow in order to allow you to tune in your workflow events only.<br />
If you want to do that, you have to listen to the following name: <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">workflow.pull_request.enter</span> .

&nbsp;

Let's do better than that: you are also able to listen to a specific transition or a state for a specific workflow:

<ul>
<li><span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">workflow.pull_request.enter.needs_review</span>: is only dispatched when a <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">needs_review</span> state is defined on our pull request. We could for instance send an email to the author with the changes the reviewer has suggested,</li>
<li><span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">workflow.pull_request.transition.merge</span>: will occur when the merge transition will be dispatched on our pull request.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

The Workflow component is a really useful component to manage state or status on most of web applications.

Do not hesitate to use it because its simplicity of configuration and use will probably help you a lot on your projects.

Also, this component helps me a lot to give people I was working with a clear vision on a complex workflow we have to manage. The graph generation allows to clarify all of that for everyone!
