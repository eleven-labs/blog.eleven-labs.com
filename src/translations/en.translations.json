It is used by companies both as sole agile method and as hybrid agile method. <strong>Its principle of dividing work into short periods of generally 2 weeks called \"sprints\"</strong>&nbsp;<strong>makes it possible to quickly come with a first version of a viable product</strong>. Each sprint is validated one after the other by the client, which allows work to be pursued on solid foundations, the following sprints aiming to further improve the product. The process is therefore significantly more productive. At Eleven Labs, we mainly work with the agile Scrum methodology and support our clients in <strong>managing their digital products</strong>, in training teams in the agile Scrum methodology or in <strong>agile coaching</strong>."
